## How China creates and consumes media

### Part 1: Kevin Lee

#### A look at the chinese consumer. 
Chinese youth born in Open Door Era. 1972–first entrepreneur. Rapid income growth.
1992-2010: Boom. Largest car market. WalMarts.
Cities grow rapidly. Largest migration in history country->city.
+2600% DGP in Schenzen

#### Hyper digital divide
All media launched 97-98. Your consumption determined by where you were then.
Chinese microblog started spring 2010. Now 200 million users.

#### Searching for identity
Start of revolution, youth wanted to be different.
Matured now. Asking "what do I want?". More focus on myself. Searching identity.
Creative culture growing. Creativity driving force for defining identity.
Youth idols used to be about being like the idol. Now about being yourself. Who am I?
New culture tribes. Driven by geeks and grassroots leaders. Empowered by socmed.

#### Social changes
Rising living cost. 100+ years to pay back loans.
Competitive job market.
Less trust on govt. Great firewall. Cencorship.
Environment. Industry scandals. 

Young ppl feel they can make a change. Social activism.
Challenging authority with socmed. __Participation counts__.
Meaning of life? Individuals seek meaning. 

#### Tech
Smart phones are mainstream. Phone before PC.
400+ million get on Internet through just phone. Never used on PC.
Old media habits such as search are uncommon.
Apps change expectations. Instant gratification. Buy cheap, install, use, delete.
Everything should come easy and cheap.

#### China specific
Brands play important role creating identity.
Critical mindset. Learning to filter info.
More active. People learn value of participation.
Consumption evolution.

## Part 2: Benjamin Joffe

### Things can be "invented" more than once.
What if movable type moved from China to Europe earlier?
Go beyond the idea that ideas come to people.
"Species" of ideas move like animal species.

### Ideas exist in ecosystems.
China has tough ecosystem. Copying is the "natural" way. Need mutation for survival/adapting.
Competition different in China. Must differentiate to distinguish from crowd.
Successful business in China started as copycat, and mutated to something else.


## Man & Machine – From Solid to Liquid to Air. Keynote by Amber Case _(The Theatre)_

We are all cyborgs. Tech is on us all the time.

Humans want to explore spaces we are not made for being in. External evolution through tools enables us to go beyond regular evolutionary processes.
Our brains are changing. Increased amount of information changes ways of remembering and sorting it. We construct filters to aid the brain.
A problem with tech is it eventually turns against you. Becomes old. Hinders you. Must always get new tech. Loop.

Private/public space blurs. We temporarily negotiate private space in the public.

Online self is becoming primary. You curate your image. Better than real-life self.
Social grooming.

Common error is trying to emulate reality. 
_Your phone will become a remote for reality._
Soon we will be "computing" without knowing it.


## How: Creating with fans and build on other peoples work

### Kirby Ferguson, everything is a remix

#### Myth

Creativity viewed as "of the Gods". We use words like "talent".
Creativity percieved as a higher achievement.
Picture of "creative genius" prevails. Genius creates from within without outer influence.
Moment of enlightenment myth.

#### Reality

Steps of creativity:

1. __Copy__. Learn the language of a culture. Bob Dylan started doing covers.
2. __Transform__. Adapt something that already exists. Edison adjusted the original lightbulb patent.
3. __Combine__. Fit other's work together to make new. Einstein did not invent E, M or C. Tim Berners Lee did not invent Hypertext, "just" the protocol.

#### Copy, transform and combine

_Example video shows scenes from Star Wars juxtaposed with identical scenes from older movies and TV series_.

#### Implications

Humans sensitive to loss.
Two obstacles: ideas are property, the lone creator.
Ideas contain ideas. Where does an idea end and another begin?

### Hanna Sköld, crowd sourced movies

Distributed first feature movie on TPB: _Nasty Old People_.
People started remixing movie on YouTube. Happy!
First live screening in Vladivostok, one week after release. People organized movie events. 

New movie: _Granny's Dancing on the Table_.
Crowd sourced script writing on Facebook.
People mix in their own life stories and identity.
_We need each other's stories_.


### Unni Drugge, crowd sourced book writing

Book called "Karriärmammans dotter" ended on a cliffhanger with choices for where the story could go.
Wanted to let readers finish the story. Afraid to get poor material, but actually got well written new chapters for the book.
Unni became a director for the book. Met with a core group of fans over dinner to discuss. Finished the book together via Google Docs.
Fans provided the enthusiasm that Unni felt she lacked.

### Q&A
Q: How to engage people?
A: Don't set high expectations. It's OK if your idea is not complete. Invite people to share what they have, no matter how polished. Set up a goal to aim for. Pieces of content should be small and easy to describe. Managable and specific. Distinguish between crowd sourcing and collaboration.

Q: Size of starting material to be able to invite?
A: Unni had half a book and was already well known writer. That helped. Collabs saw opportunity to contribute to something great.

Q: Should I pay my crowd?
A: Be clear on what you recieve for contributing. Crowd don't work for profit, they work for the cause, but if you make money off their work they want somthing in return. Credits, shares. 


## Funding creativity with the crowd

### Daniel Daboczy, Fundedbyme

Crowdfunding word <10 yrs old, but concept a lot older. We have new tools that makes it easier.

Key to crowd sourcing is enabling people to feel part of something.

* Crowd sourcing. We work for progress.
* Crowdfunding. We contribute with money for progress.
* Equity crowdfunding. We contribute with money in return for shares.

#### The rise of the creative and social class.

A new class of people who want to:

* Be involved
* Be useful
* Feel part of...

Will work as ambassadors for you.
Money raised is a positive side effect. Building a crowd is the real winning.
