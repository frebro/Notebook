Chinese microblog started spring 2010. Now 200 million users.

#### Searching for identity
Start of revolution, youth wanted to be different.
Matured now. Asking "what do I want?". More focus on myself. Searching identity.
Creative culture growing. Creativity driving force for defining identity.
Youth idols used to be about being like the idol. Now about being yourself. Who am I?
New culture tribes. Driven by geeks and grassroots leaders. Empowered by socmed.

#### Social changes
Rising living cost. 100+ years to pay back loans.
Competitive job market.
Less trust on govt. Great firewall. Cencorship.
Environment. Industry scandals. 

Young ppl feel they can make a change. Social activism.
Challenging authority with socmed. __Participation counts__.
Meaning of life? Individuals seek meaning. 

#### Tech
Smart phones are mainstream. Phone before PC.
400+ million get on Internet through just phone. Never used on PC.
Old media habits such as search are uncommon.
Apps change expectations. Instant gratification. Buy cheap, install, use, delete.
Everything should come easy and cheap.

#### China specific
Brands play important role creating identity.
Critical mindset. Learning to filter info.
More active. People learn value of participation.
Consumption evolution.

## Part 2: Benjamin Joffe

### Things can be "invented" more than once.
What if movable type moved from China to Europe earlier?
Go beyond the idea that ideas come to people.
"Species" of ideas move like animal species.

### Ideas exist in ecosystems.
China has tough ecosystem. Copying is the "natural" way. Need mutation for survival/adapting.
Competition different in China. Must differentiate to distinguish from crowd.
Successful business in China started as copycat, and mutated to something else.


## Man & Machine – From Solid to Liquid to Air. Keynote by Amber Case _(The Theatre)_

We are all cyborgs. Tech is on us all the time.

Humans want to explore spaces we are not made for being in. External evolution through tools enables us to go beyond regular evolutionary processes.
Our brains are changing. Increased amount of information changes ways of remembering and sorting it. We construct filters to aid the brain.
A problem with tech is it eventually turns against you. Becomes old. Hinders you. Must always get new tech. Loop.

Private/public space blurs. We temporarily negotiate private space in the public.

Online self is becoming primary. You curate your image. Better than real-life self.
Social grooming.

Common error is trying to emulate reality. 
_Your phone will become a remote for reality._
Soon we will be "computing" without knowing it.
